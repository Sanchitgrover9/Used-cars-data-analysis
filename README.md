# Used-cars-data-analysis

The Used Cars Data Analysis project focuses on analyzing various factors related to used cars, using visual tools to gain insights from the data. Here’s a simple description of the project:

Objective: The goal of this project is to analyze used car sales data, focusing on key metrics like average engine size, kilometers driven, mileage, power, seats, and price. It also explores the relationship between various factors like car transmission, location, and year of sale.

Key Metrics:

Average engine size: 1,621 cc
Average kilometers driven: 58,738 km
Average mileage: 18 km/l
Average power: 113 bhp
Average number of seats: 5
Average price: ₹9 lakh
Visualizations:

A bar chart shows the number of car records by year, with a noticeable increase in sales between 2010 and 2015.
A boxplot compares the prices of cars with automatic and manual transmissions, highlighting price variations.
A bump chart ranks the average car price in different locations for each year, showing how prices change in cities like Delhi, Bangalore, and Mumbai over time.
A table compares each location’s average car price to a target price, calculating the percentage difference.
Filters and Parameters: Users can filter the data based on different criteria such as fuel type, location, owner type, transmission type, and year to customize the analysis.

In this project, data was cleaned and processed to make meaningful visualizations, helping to understand car pricing trends, location-wise preferences, and other important aspects related to used car sales.
